PROJECT CONTENT TEMPLATE

!! IMPORTANT: !!
- Copy this file into your project folder under /public/assets/case studies/{project}/ and rename it to content.ts.
- Do NOT overwrite or edit this template file directly.
- Each project should have its own copy of this file, filled out with project-specific content.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CASE STUDY CONTENT TEMPLATE

- Fill out this file for each project under /public/assets/case studies/{project}/.
- All fields marked with a ? are optional; you can leave them out if not needed.
- 'projectHeading' and 'details' are required for every project.
- 'infoSnippets' is an array: each snippet can have text, visuals, and a custom layout (columns for text/visuals, total 12).
- For visuals, use type 'image' for local images, 'video' for YouTube/Vimeo links, 'embed' for other web/app embeds, 'lottie' for Lottie animations, or 'component' for custom React components.
- You can add or remove snippets as needed for your project.
- Example usage is provided below the interfaces.
