## ✅ COMPLETED: Case Study Routing Implementation

### Problem
- Case studies were previously displayed as sections on the landing page, limiting SEO and user experience
- No dedicated URLs for individual case studies
- Landing page became cluttered with case study content

### Solution Implemented
- **Dynamic Routes**: Created `/case-study/[slug]` dynamic routing structure
- **Client Components**: Case study pages use `"use client"` directive for proper event handling
- **Content Loading**: Content loads from TypeScript files with proper Promise handling using `React.use()`
- **Navigation**: ProjectSlider cards now navigate to dedicated pages instead of revealing sections
- **Layout Consistency**: Case study pages maintain same structure as landing page (AccentDock, ProjectDetailsDisplay, InfoSnippets)
- **Scroll Lock Fix**: Resolved scroll lock issue by matching landing page CSS structure and removing problematic `pointer-events-auto` class

### Files Modified
- `app/case-study/[slug]/page.tsx` (new file)
- `components/ProjectSlider/ProjectSlider.tsx` (navigation logic)
- `public/assets/landing/project-slider-cards.ts` (added slug property)
- Various component files with `"use client"` directives

### Result
- ✅ Individual case study URLs (e.g., `/case-study/project1`)
- ✅ Better SEO with dedicated pages
- ✅ Improved user experience with proper navigation
- ✅ Consistent layout and functionality across pages
- ✅ No scroll lock issues

## Issue: InfoSnippet Body Array Flattening (Mixed Content)

### Problem
- When using an array for the `body` property in InfoSnippet (e.g., `[string, string[]]`), the component receives a single string with embedded line breaks and bullets, not the original array structure.
- This causes the UI to render a single `<p>` with `<br>` and bullet characters, instead of a paragraph and a custom-styled bullet list.

### Steps Taken & Discoveries

1. **Confirmed Content Structure**
   - The original content file (`public/assets/case studies/project1/content.ts`) and the synced file (`content/case studies/project1/content.ts`) both have the correct array structure for the `body` property, including mixed arrays (string + nested array).

2. **Checked Sync Scripts**
   - The sync script (`sync-content.js`) only copies files and does not transform or flatten arrays.

3. **Inspected InfoSnippet Component**
   - Added `console.log('snippet.body:', snippet.body);` to the InfoSnippet component.
   - Found that for mixed arrays, `snippet.body` is a string with embedded line breaks and bullets, not an array.
   - For arrays with only strings, the array structure is preserved and renders correctly as a bullet list.

4. **Tested Direct Import**
   - The content file is imported directly as a TypeScript module in `app/page.tsx`:
     ```ts
     import caseStudy from "../public/assets/case studies/project1/content";
     ```
   - This should preserve the array structure, unless something else mutates the data.

5. **Hypothesis**
   - The issue likely occurs in the data flow between the content import and the InfoSnippet component, possibly due to a transformation, mapping, or joining step that flattens mixed arrays to a string.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Add a `console.log(caseStudy.infoSnippets)` in `app/page.tsx` to check if the array structure is preserved immediately after import.
   - If the array is preserved, the problem is in the rendering logic or a mutation before passing to InfoSnippet.
   - If the array is already a string, the problem is in the import or a build step.

### To Do
- Investigate the data flow from import to component.
- Ensure no transformation or flattening occurs for mixed arrays.
- Update this backlog with findings and the final fix.

## ✅ COMPLETED: InfoTile Component & Grid Configuration System

### Problem
- Need for a simple, reusable card component for displaying information with icons and text
- Multiple visuals in InfoSnippet components needed custom grid layouts
- No way to specify exact column and row configurations for visual grids

### Solution Implemented

#### InfoTile Component
- **Simple Card Design**: Created reusable InfoTile component with icon, heading, and body text
- **Flexible Props**: All props are optional - can be used with just an icon, just text, or any combination
- **Fixed Dimensions**: 320px width × 260px height (1.23:1 aspect ratio) for consistent layout
- **Icon Support**: Accepts React components, string identifiers, or URL-based SVGs
- **Animated Border**: Optional animated border with accent color trim path animation (20-second cycle)
- **Styling Consistency**: Matches ProjectStats component design patterns
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with VisualRenderer for InfoSnippet components

#### Grid Configuration System
- **Custom Grid Layouts**: Added `gridCols` and `gridRows` props to CanvasSection component
- **Content-based Configuration**: Updated InfoSnippet interface in all content files
- **Prop-based Configuration**: Support for overriding grid layout via component props
- **Tailwind Integration**: Uses explicit grid classes for reliable CSS generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing content works without changes

### Files Modified
- `components/InfoTile/` (new directory with complete component)
- `components/InfoSnippet/CanvasSection.tsx` (grid configuration)
- `app/globals.css` (animated border keyframes)
- `components/InfoSnippet/types.ts` (updated interfaces)
- `components/InfoSnippet/InfoSnippet.tsx` (prop passing)
- `components/InfoSnippet/VisualRenderer.tsx` (InfoTile integration)
- All content files: `public/assets/case studies/*/content.ts` (updated interfaces)
- `public/assets/case studies/project-content-template.ts` (template updates)

### Usage Examples
```typescript
// InfoTile in content
{
  type: "component",
  componentName: "InfoTile",
  componentProps: {
    icon: "chart",
    heading: "Revenue Growth",
    body: "Increased revenue by 25%",
    color: "blue"
  }
}

// Grid configuration
{
  layout: {
    textColumns: 6,
    visualColumns: 6,
    gridCols: 2,  // 2 columns
    gridRows: 2   // 2 rows
  }
}
```

### Result
- ✅ Reusable InfoTile component for consistent information display
- ✅ Custom grid layouts for multiple visuals
- ✅ Content-based and prop-based configuration options
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing content
- ✅ Consistent styling and responsive design

## ✅ COMPLETED: ProjectStats Component Implementation

### Problem
- Need for a statistics display component to show business metrics and project data
- Required multiple layout options for different use cases
- Needed animated number counting for engaging data presentation

### Solution Implemented

#### ProjectStats Component
- **Multiple Layouts**: Grid, Cards, Combined, and ComboStats layouts
- **Animated Numbers**: Built-in AnimatedNumber component for counting animations
- **Color Coding**: Support for different color schemes (blue, purple, green, orange, indigo, accent)
- **ComboStats Layout**: Specialized business layout with corporate operations and authorized network sections
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with proper mobile support
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with VisualRenderer for InfoSnippet components

#### Technical Implementation
- **Component**: `SimpleProjectStats` in `components/ProjectStats/SimpleProjectStats.tsx`
- **Animation**: Fixed width containers to prevent layout shifts during number animation
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions with layout options including 'ComboStats'
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused files with lucide-react dependencies

### Files Modified
- `components/ProjectStats/SimpleProjectStats.tsx` (main component)
- `components/ProjectStats/types.ts` (updated with ComboStats layout)
- `components/ProjectStats/index.ts` (exports SimpleProjectStats)
- `components/InfoSnippet/VisualRenderer.tsx` (component registration)
- Removed unused files: `ProjectStats.tsx`, `StatCard.tsx`, `utils.ts`, `example.tsx`

### Usage Examples
```typescript
// ProjectStats in content
{
  type: "component",
  componentName: "ProjectStats",
  componentProps: {
    title: "Market Leadership",
    subtitle: "Powering retail excellence through strategic operations",
    stats: [
      {
        value: 28,
        label: "Billion Revenue",
        color: "blue",
        prefix: "$",
        suffix: "B",
        animateValue: true
      }
    ],
    layout: "ComboStats"
  }
}
```

### Result
- ✅ Reusable ProjectStats component for business statistics
- ✅ Multiple layout options including specialized ComboStats layout
- ✅ Smooth animated number counting without layout shifts
- ✅ Proper TypeScript integration and type safety
- ✅ Clean component architecture without external dependencies
